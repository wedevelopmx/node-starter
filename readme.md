## Third Party Software

We are using a predefined theme known as FLATKIT, we host our licence code in bitbucket private repository. Ask for access to the repository to our project manager, he will upload your SSH, and your environment will download the repository when you execute bower. Same process is expected if you are deploying the application to cloud environment.

If you are not part of we develop you can purchase a license on [Flatkit Oficial Page](http://flatfull.com/themes/flatkit/), then you have to place it under folder /public/vendor before executing grunt.
